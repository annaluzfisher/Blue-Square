Item.create(name:'Impulse-112-Skis',description:'Built for freeriders who love playful, deep-snow performance yet demand control when launching down steep, aggressive lines, the Impulse 112â€™s are the big guns you want on a storm day. Wide-waisted at 112-mm, these skis are floaty for deep conditions, while the playful turning radius keeps them nimble for lines that require confidence and accuracy. Their flat, solid-core construction adds torsional stiffness and provides premium power transmission, dampness and stability to hold fast while charging on harder snow. Austrian-made with pre-preg fiberglass and an engineered poplar core, The Impulse 112 is built for the progressive freerider looking to get after it.',price:799.95)
